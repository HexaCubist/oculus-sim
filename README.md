oculus-sim
==========

web-based simulator of the Oculus VR headsets

goal: to give a rough, qualitative understanding on various parameters (resolution, persistence, etc) related to the Oculus Rift headset prototypes, given the constraints of portraying one display technology on another.

viewable [here](http://vr.quasi.co/oculus-sim).

### todo

* make low persistence toggle actual _motion_ blur
* dynamic scanline usage
* sensor drift => camera exhibits a slow but steady rotation
* group settings: based on device vs parameters
* scene loading: multiple scenes, such as tuscany
* control render size+resolution to improve accuracy of percieved screen
* play with bi-directionalizing scanlines for 'screen door' effect
* enable finer grain control of shader effects
* polish
