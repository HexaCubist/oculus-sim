oculus-sim
==========

Web-based simulator of the Oculus VR headsets

Goal: to give a rough, qualitative understanding on various display parameters (resolution, persistence, etc) related to the Oculus Rift headset prototypes, given the constraints of portraying one display technology on another.

### todo

* side by side comparison render
* sensor drift => camera exhibits a slow but steady rotation
* scene loading: multiple scenes, such as tuscany
* enable finer grain control of shader effects
